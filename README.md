## About

Practice of the workflow of training deep model with pytorch and transform to tensorflow.js-compatible format for web frontend deployment.

## Example App
https://pkucuipy.github.io/handwriting-recognizer-torch-to-tfjs/


## Repo Structure

- `model-training/`: Scripts to train a handwritten digit recognition model on PyTorch using the MNIST dataset. The model weights is then transform into tensorflow.js-compatible format.
- `frontend-ui/`: A react app that uses this model for interactive digit recognition.

> Refer to the README file in `model-training/` for more information.
